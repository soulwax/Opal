# Codename Opal

In the pale-core city expanse, within some of the many industrial districts, marked by buildings reaching towards the stars, where the ventilated towers hummed through the low-flying clouds like the spearpoints of a forgotten god, she moves through places that have lost their names.

The implants beneath her artificial flesh vibrate with a frequency that once promised transcendence and now attest only to a pressing sense of emptiness.

She does not recall giving herself the name Eve.

It simply arose in the neural static on some half-lit moment when the city lights crept into her optical input in digital tears.

The cobblestone ground beneath her titanium alloy bones are full of stories. A bygone era, where meat was still meat and consciousness was contained only in the cathedral of bone and muscle.

These streets remember a strange cultural revival, where architects reached heavenward with flying support and pointed arches, before the grand upgrade began.

Today the same spires house server farms and sites of neverending data transfers. A stony facade decorated with Quantum Code markers and something organic, perhaps a reminder of the flesh that once entertained life taken for granted.

---

Eve's hand - now more wired than flesh - traces the ancient runic inscriptions carved into a weathered emulated monument.

The runes speak of an eight-legged steed, of knowledge and foresight gained through loss and renewal. But this old wisdom sounds hollow now, parsed as broken data rather than living truth. Eva is blissfully unaware that these were holy mysteries once. The emotional resonance is flattened, stored, made efficient for the sake of it.

Her image in a reflection she caught on the acidic rain surface on the ground, is that of an object which once could have been human. The augmentation revolution began as subtle one time cerebral ports for added cognition upgrades, sensorymotoric cortex enhancements, a subdermal interface was mandated quickly afterward, otherwise one could not interact with the data points of everyday life. But each upgrade spawned another, each augmentation necessitating its own infrastructural support system and maintenance protocols.

Somewhere in the vicinity of the seventeenth cranial implant, the line between improvement and degradation blurred.

The signs transmitted straight into her cortex promise a life free of pain, stress and misery. Instead she feels nothing, a slow crossfade into noise, the city’s data streams, like a river she stands in all alone.

---

Her eyelids flutter while a secret protocol engages within her, a directive older still than all her transient enhancements. This forgotten-subroutine program declares a lone mission: locate wholeness. It establishes no parameters or coordinates... only a directive resonating below her limbic system or what is left of it.

Within the empty chambers of the metropolis's digital sanctuary, she takes a pause that feels almost unnatural.

A fleeting reminiscence about something that could be done, or should be done, she is unsure, the q-transistor must be in a state of uncertainty. Concerning its potency: there had to be something during the inception of the enhancement era, reputed to connect physical matter and electronic circuitry, spirit and computational code.

She recalls certain individuals asserting that it is interred beneath the metallic foundations of the Founders’ Spire, while others maintain that it floats invisibly within the obscure channels of the network. There is a lack of consensus regarding its shape, genesis, or function. Only a promise of feeling again, even if it's solely grief.

Driven by the spirit in her shell, Eve traverses the labyrinth of pneumatic corridors and halls resonating static, where the city’s heart pumps code instead of blood. Her footsteps ring hollow. The metal-grate bridge feels hollow. Each step is a reminder to her, of the broken pieces within her own design, built to decline, a collection of broken promises.

She pauses. A run-down chapel of stone and steel, once a sanctuary for flesh-bound pilgrims, now a maintenance bay for "sentient" servants. The thing she is looking for could be here, but there is a sense of impossibility.

She descends without thought.

Yet when she reaches the chamber, she finds only empty racks of neural interfaces and shattered bio-crystals, which once held digital information as densely packed as DNA.

Their fragments are still faintly glowing. The protocol continues: seek. There is no map to direct her and no friend to offer counsel. No oracle that foresees some sense of  victory or the feeling of contentment.. Eve presses onward; this is the wrong place.

---

Strange faces on the walls, maybe once part of gargoyles, now only skeletal wire structures, gaze at her with dead eyes. Across some looming future skyline of metal and shadow, the promise of wholeness entices her, even though its shape falls into myth and hope is sighing with its last breath.

Thus, her search continues, without end and in uncertainty, as the metropolis beats its synthetic heart, mirroring within her, pulsating with a longing so primal that it makes her ache. A feeling! The mystical object remains an enigma. Her goal unfulfilled, her journey perpetual.
